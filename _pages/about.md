Chuol Ruei Deng is a South Sudanese scholar, researcher, and community leader who has journeyed from life in a refugee camp to the global stage of academia and social impact. He is a graduate of New York University with a degree in Economics and Mathematics, and is currently pursuing a Master’s in Development Engineering. His work sits at the intersection of economic development, data analysis, and technology for social good, with a special focus on education, sustainable development, and community resilience.

As the Founder and CEO of the Thok Nath Research Institute and the Bangtigow Foundation, Chuol is committed to preserving the cultural identity of the Nuer people while advancing education and opportunities for underserved youth in refugee and IDP communities. He has led initiatives in language preservation, mentorship, and digital education, including efforts to standardize the Thok Nath language and add it to Google Translate.

Beyond academia, Chuol has collaborated with organizations such as BBC World News, NYU CTED, and PANGEA Educational Development, contributing to research and projects that address global challenges—from climate change and displacement to educational inequity. His vision is deeply rooted in the belief that knowledge, when paired with empathy and innovation, can transform communities.

With aspirations in management consulting, policy, and advanced research (PhD), Chuol continues to bridge local realities with global solutions—proving that resilience, education, and leadership can turn challenges into opportunities for lasting impact.
