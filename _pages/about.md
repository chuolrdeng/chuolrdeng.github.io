## About Me
---
I am a graduate of New York University with a degree in Economics and Mathematics and am currently pursuing my Master’s in Development Engineering, with a focus on AI and Data Science for corporate, NGO, and government applications. I have worked as a Project Manager with MIT’s Emerging Talent Program, an Economic Analyst with the Milken Institute, a Research Assistant at NYU Abu Dhabi’s Center for Technology and Economic Development, and a Data Analyst with Pangea Educational Development. These roles have allowed me to bridge research, data, and policy to address development and economic challenges at both local and global levels.

Beyond my academic and professional experience, I also run two nonprofit organizations: the Romro Foundation, which supports underprivileged students with access to education and mentorship, and the Thok Nath Research Institute, which advances cultural preservation, education, and technology initiatives. Through these initiatives, I have collaborated with Google and the BBC, highlighting my commitment to driving innovation and impact across diverse sectors.
