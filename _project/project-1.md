This project introduced the fundamentals of reproducible workflows in computational social science.  
I learned how to create and manage GitHub repositories, track changes with Git, and collaborate with teammates through branches, pull requests, and reviews.  

The project also included creating a personal website using GitHub Pages, where I documented my work and showcased my progress.  
These skills form the foundation for transparent and collaborative research practices.
